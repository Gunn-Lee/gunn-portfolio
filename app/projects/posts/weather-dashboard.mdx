# Weather Dashboard

An interactive weather dashboard that provides comprehensive weather information with beautiful visualizations and location-based forecasts.

## Features Overview

- **Current Weather**: Real-time weather conditions for any location
- **7-Day Forecast**: Detailed week-ahead weather predictions
- **Interactive Maps**: Weather overlay maps with radar and satellite imagery
- **Location Search**: Search weather by city name or coordinates
- **Favorites**: Save frequently checked locations
- **Data Visualization**: Charts and graphs for temperature, humidity, and precipitation trends

## Technology Highlights

### Frontend Framework

Built with Vue.js 3 for reactive user interface with composition API for better code organization and reusability.

### Data Visualization

Leveraged D3.js to create interactive charts showing weather trends, temperature variations, and precipitation patterns.

### Mapping Integration

Integrated Mapbox for interactive weather maps with custom overlays for radar and satellite imagery.

## API Integration

```javascript
// Weather API service
export const weatherService = {
  async getCurrentWeather(lat, lon) {
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=${lat}&lon=${lon}&appid=${API_KEY}&units=metric`
    )
    return response.json()
  },

  async getForecast(lat, lon) {
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat=${lat}&lon=${lon}&appid=${API_KEY}&units=metric`
    )
    return response.json()
  },
}
```

## Design Philosophy

### Responsive Design

The dashboard adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing optimal viewing experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

### Performance Optimization

- Implemented caching strategies for API responses
- Lazy loading for map components
- Debounced search functionality to minimize API calls

### User Experience

- Intuitive navigation between different weather views
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Accessible design following WCAG guidelines

## Technical Challenges

1. **API Rate Limiting**: Implemented smart caching to minimize API calls while keeping data fresh
2. **Map Performance**: Optimized map rendering for smooth interaction with weather overlays
3. **Data Accuracy**: Handled API errors gracefully and provided fallback data sources

This project demonstrates expertise in modern frontend frameworks, API integration, data visualization, and creating polished user experiences.
