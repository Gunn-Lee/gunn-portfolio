# E-Commerce Platform

This is a modern e-commerce platform built with cutting-edge technologies to provide a seamless shopping experience.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login
- **Product Catalog**: Browse and search through products
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, remove, and manage cart items
- **Payment Processing**: Secure payments with Stripe
- **Order Management**: Track orders and order history
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage products, orders, and users

## Key Highlights

### Performance

The platform is optimized for speed with Next.js 14 App Router, delivering lightning-fast page loads and smooth navigation.

### Security

Implemented secure authentication with NextAuth.js and encrypted payment processing with Stripe.

### Responsive Design

Fully responsive design that works seamlessly across all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.

## Technical Implementation

The backend uses PostgreSQL with Prisma as the ORM for efficient data management. The frontend leverages React Server Components for optimal performance and SEO.

```typescript
// Example API route for products
export async function GET() {
  const products = await prisma.product.findMany({
    include: {
      category: true,
      images: true,
    },
  })

  return Response.json(products)
}
```

## Challenges Overcome

- Implemented complex cart state management across server and client components
- Optimized database queries for large product catalogs
- Built a robust order processing system with inventory management

This project demonstrates proficiency in full-stack development, payment integration, and modern web technologies.
