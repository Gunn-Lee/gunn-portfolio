# Task Management App

A collaborative task management application that enables teams to organize, track, and complete projects efficiently with real-time collaboration features.

## Core Features

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can work simultaneously with live updates
- **Project Organization**: Create and manage multiple projects with different team members
- **Task Tracking**: Comprehensive task creation, assignment, and progress tracking
- **Team Management**: Invite team members and manage permissions
- **Notifications**: Real-time notifications for task updates and deadlines
- **Dashboard Analytics**: Visual insights into project progress and team productivity

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend

Built with React and Material-UI for a clean, intuitive user interface. The app uses Context API for state management and React Query for efficient data fetching and caching.

### Backend

Node.js and Express server with MongoDB for data persistence. Socket.io enables real-time communication between clients.

### Real-time Features

```javascript
// Socket.io implementation for real-time task updates
socket.on('taskUpdated', (task) => {
  setTasks((prevTasks) => prevTasks.map((t) => (t.id === task.id ? task : t)))
})

socket.emit('updateTask', updatedTask)
```

## Key Achievements

- **Performance**: Implemented efficient real-time updates without overwhelming the server
- **Scalability**: Designed the architecture to handle multiple concurrent users
- **User Experience**: Created an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for task management
- **Security**: Implemented JWT authentication and role-based access control

## Challenges Solved

1. **Real-time Synchronization**: Ensuring data consistency across multiple clients
2. **Offline Support**: Implementing offline functionality with sync when connection restored
3. **Performance Optimization**: Minimizing re-renders and optimizing Socket.io events

This project showcases full-stack development skills, real-time application architecture, and collaborative software design principles.
