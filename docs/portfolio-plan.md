# Portfolio Implementation Plan

## Research & Inspiration
- Explore modern front-end engineer portfolios focusing on bold typography, gradients, and smooth scroll-triggered animations for inspiration.
- Due to the offline environment, rely on previously known references such as Frontend Mentor showcase sites and award-winning portfolio layouts to guide design decisions.

## Content Strategy
- Translate resume highlights into narrative sections: hero intro, skills showcase, experience timeline, and project gallery with placeholders.
- Surface contact information and social links prominently to encourage outreach.

## Visual Direction
- Lean into a neon-on-dark aesthetic with layered gradients, glassmorphism cards, and flowing organic shapes to emphasize creativity.
- Employ subtle parallax, animated gradients, and staggered entrance animations to give a dynamic feel without overwhelming performance.

## Information Architecture
1. **Hero** – Animated background, headline, short pitch, CTA buttons.
2. **About** – Personal summary and quick stats from the resume.
3. **Skills** – Categorized pill list (Front-End, Back-End, Tools) with hover animations.
4. **Experience** – Timeline cards featuring achievements from each role.
5. **Projects** – Masonry-like grid with mock projects containing placeholders for images and descriptions.
6. **Call-to-Action** – Contact prompt with social links and download resume button.

## Technical Approach
- Build reusable React components under `app/components/portfolio` for modularity.
- Use TailwindCSS utilities already configured in the project for styling; extend with keyframe animations in `global.css` as needed.
- Leverage `framer-motion` for entrance animations if available; otherwise create CSS-based animation utilities.
- Implement responsive design using CSS grid/flex and clamp-based typography.

## Data Modeling
- Create structured data objects for experience, skills, and project placeholders to ease future updates.
- Ensure project items include title, description, stack tags, and image placeholder URL.

## Deliverables
- Update `app/page.tsx` to render the new portfolio layout composed of the modular components.
- Add any required animation styles or utilities in shared CSS.
- Provide clear placeholder content and comments where the user can swap in real project assets.

## Testing & Validation
- Verify responsive behavior via Tailwind breakpoints within the development environment.
- Run `pnpm lint` to maintain code quality.
